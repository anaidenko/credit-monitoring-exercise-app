# Exercise

A Fintech partner is integrating our credit monitoring and reporting tools into their mobile application.
They want to provide credit locking, freezing, and identity protection services to their users. They would prefer we offer them quick and easy WebView URL's they can access inside their mobile application from any platform.
We would like you to build two pages (one for credit lock and freezing, and one for identity protection) in Next.js. We are a React shop with a focus on performance and time to first byte.

The objectives are:
* Build an identity protection page.
* Enable the toggling of identity protection and correct display of identity protection status upon reload. 
* Build a credit lock page.
* Enable the toggling of credit lock features and correct display of credit lock status upon reload. 
* Display the credit lock/unlock history for the user. 

For this, you will require our API documentation, which can be found at https://apimatic.io/apidocs/array and specifically look for the Monitoring endpoints.
